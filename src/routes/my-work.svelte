			<p>
				BrewerMe is a full stack application built on Sveltekit, supabase,
				TailwindCSS, Node.js, and Express. It allows users to input a city and
				get returned a list of breweries in that city. The user can then click
				on a brewery to get more information about that brewery. The user can
				also add the brewery to their favorites list to come back to it later. I
				plan on implementing a google map that populates the brewery location
				for user. I would like to implement a beer rating system to the app as
				well if I have the time. I started the app in svelte vanilla and learned
				about sveltekit after building out some of the features, I am porting it
				over to the sveltekit app to allow for easier routing and backend.

			<p>
				Green Genie is an app that aims to give any marijauna plant growing
				enthusiast, a database to log for marijuana strains. It will also give
				you the location of your local despensaries. My responsibilities on this
				project were the back end, making sure the routes worked properly, and
				the authentication both front and back end for that. I also did a bit of
				the handlebars.js work and some of the styling on the web pages. Click
