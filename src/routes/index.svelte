            I am a software engineer in the Chicagoland Area. I currently work at a startup in the Mortgage industry developing desktop applications in C#.
            I have a passion for problem solving and I am always looking to learn new things.

            I'm a former Mechanical Engineer who had an interest in coding and software engineering since I learned it in college. I am currently 
            a Software Engineer working at a small comapny that automates the Mortgage process for banks and home lenders. We work with in C# and SQL primarily
            with some cloud based technologies sprinkled in. I decided to make a career switch in 2021 and took a coding bootcamp at the Northwestern University.
            It was a 6 month program focused on web development. I enjoeyed learning about all the new technologies and frameworks that were introduced. We built up 
            to a mern stack, learning about SQL databases and ORMs along the way. I mainly code for work now, but when I dabble with web development on the side
            I like using Sveltekit to build my apps.
