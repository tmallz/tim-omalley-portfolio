                        My name is Timothy O'Malley, an apsiring Software Engineer/Web Developer. In college I worked with C and C++ and have a pretty strong foundation those. I am currently
                        a mechanincal engineer that does HVAC engineering for industrial/commercial buildings. This isn't directly related to software/web development I think a lot of the 
                        problem solving skills I have from engineering will be applicable in a the tech industry.

                        I am currently taking a 6 month coding bootcamp at Northwestern University to get the skills necessary to become a full stack web developer. As of now we have done a 
                        done a lot of work with HTML/CSS/Javascript and many other technologies in conjunction with them on both the front end and the back end. These other technologies can
                        be seen on the projects showcased on this page, on my github

                        Green Genie is a app that aims to give any marijauna plant growing enthusiast, a database to log for marijuana strains. It will also give 
                        you the location of your local despensaries. My responsibilities on this project were the back end, making sure the routes worked properly, 
                        and the authentication both front and back end for that. I also did a bit of the handlebars.js work and some of the styling on the web pages.
